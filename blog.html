            Our game is called "Crptograhpy Quest" and it is an interactive baord game that uses Crryptograhpy to move forward whilst trying to escape a monster (a rubber ducky in our case). It uses Caesar Cipher and key word shift to decrypt messages throughout the game. Each message is hand decrypted with no devices and has a 30 second time limit. Players can escape a run in with the monster by decrypting a challenge card. Our challenges in creating the game came with time. We did not have enopught time to create all of the encryptions that we wanted, meaning that we did not have enough moves to win the game. We took time while testing the game to troubshoot the game with Laurie. She helped us understand the particality of the game and how to make it competitive or fun depending on the player/team. If we had more time to work on the game I would suggest that we have a higher quality set up, along with more complex encryptions. I would suggest a timer to make the game more intense for players that enjoy that. Overall, i really enjoyed the game and think that it was well done for the time that was given.

            I chose this particular video to talk about HTML because it ties into our lesson from July 2023 about USer Experience and how the interface of an app and website are designed. I also think that including basic HTML and CSS togther in a short tutorial is a great way to teach others HTML. I really love coding HTMl and this video really hits all of my favorite parts.

             <p>  This meme displays the popular TV show character Pam Beesley holding up two sign comparing data science, also known as DS in the IT world. Machine Learning is  using algorithms models to analyze and draw conclusions from patterns in collected data.Data science is a topic that combines computer science, statics, AI (artifical intelligence), and Machine Learning to analyze and sort data with algorithms. The meme shows that these two disciplines have very similar defintions and are often mistaken for each other to those who are new in the data science field. Referred to as "DS Noobs" in the meme, this implies that they are new data science students getting their BS/BA or MS in Data Science. This meme provides a humurous to explain that machine learning and data science are very similar to each other and are often cofused wiith the other by new data scientists.
