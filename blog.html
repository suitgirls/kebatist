            The infographic displayed on my website is about the gender, race, and age regardless of women working in the STEM field. The infographic addresses the different sectors of race, subject, 
        <p>
            I also was able to address ethnicity and race in my infographic by breaking down the sections within the workforce. While doing this I also addressed the percentage of women in each subject.

            Our game is called "Crptograhpy Quest" and it is an interactive board game that uses Cryptograhpy to move forward whilst trying to escape a monster (a rubber ducky in our case). It uses Caesar Cipher and keyword shift to decrypt messages throughout the game. Each message is hand decrypted with no devices and has a 30-second time limit. Players can escape a run-in with the monster by decrypting a challenge card. Our challenges in creating the game came with time. We did not have enough time to create all of the encryptions that we wanted, meaning that we did not have enough moves to win the game. We took time while testing the game to troubleshoot the game with Laurie. She helped us understand the practicality of the game and how to make it competitive or fun depending on the player/team. If we had more time to work on the game I would suggest that we have a higher-quality setup, along with more complex encryptions. I would suggest a timer to make the game more intense for players that enjoy that. Overall, I really enjoyed the game and think that it was well done for the time that was given.

            I chose this particular video to talk about HTML because it ties into our lesson from July 2023 about User Experience and how the interface of an app and website are designed. I also think that including basic HTML and CSS together in a short tutorial is a great way to teach others HTML. I really love coding HTMl and this video really hits all of my favorite parts.

             <p>  This meme displays the popular TV show character Pam Beesley holding up two signs comparing data science, also known as DS in the IT world. Machine Learning is using algorithms models to analyze and draw conclusions from patterns in collected data. Data science is a topic that combines computer science, statistics, AI (artificial intelligence), and Machine Learning to analyze and sort data with algorithms. The meme shows that these two disciplines have very similar definitions and are often mistaken for each other by those who are new in the data science field. Referred to as "DS Noobs" in the meme, this implies that they are new data science students getting their BS/BA or MS in Data Science. This meme provides a humorous way to explain that machine learning and data science are very similar to each other and are often confused with the other by new data scientists.

            Maureen Baginski began working as a cryptologist as a Russian language instructor in 1979 in Russia, the NSA during 9/11, and the FBI. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Baginski was involved in the 9/11 terrorist as she was able to guide the actions of the NSA directly following the attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            She worked for The National Security Operations Center and the Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) as an officer for many years as a cryptologist. However, 
           she was transferred to the FBI where she became the director of Intelligence from 2003-2005. After this, she accepted a position to work as a senior intelligence executive within the FBI. 
        <p>
            Baginski was President of National Security Systems at SPARTA after retiring from the FBI, along with several other companies.
