            I really enjoyed exploring Seaseme Street with my fellow IT Girls. We were able to bond over the little things that we have all experienced throughout our lives. I learned a lot about everyone while we spent the day together.

            Hannah and I worked together to create a program about including women within the gaming design field and catering the games toward both genders. Women are often left out of the conversation when creating content in games. We were able to address how we could include women and get them more involved in the development of games. We were able to ask the question, "How can we involve women in traditional gaming spaces?"

            My favorite robot is Wall-E because he represents the depressing nature of the human mind in society. I believe that he represents the idea of a classically boring life and the negativity exhibited in our lives. I connect with Wall-E because it is very difficult to not only see the negative things that our lives have to offer us. Wall- E humanized AI and robots for us by showing us that they are created by someone somewhere. However, it also shows robots are not human. They will continue to work and do their jobs potentially when someone is not even telling them to do something. We as people are naturally subjected to the idea that everything will turn “sour.” I think meeting Rae showed me that robots can be useful to our world and we may be able to connect with them. Especially if there is someone else on the other end. In the future, I think addressing how robots activate the human mind whether it be AI or a physical robot. We also have to use robots and AI with caution, realizing that sometimes those can be biased too. Humans have to trust themselves without the help of interactive technology.

            Our game is called "Crptograhpy Quest" and it is an interactive board game that uses Cryptograhpy to move forward whilst trying to escape a monster (a rubber ducky in our case). It uses Caesar Cipher and keyword shift to decrypt messages throughout the game. Each message is hand decrypted with no devices and has a 30-second time limit. Players can escape a run-in with the monster by decrypting a challenge card. Our challenges in creating the game came with time. We did not have enough time to create all of the encryptions that we wanted, meaning that we did not have enough moves to win the game. We took time while testing the game to troubleshoot the game with Laurie. She helped us understand the practicality of the game and how to make it competitive or fun depending on the player/team. If we had more time to work on the game I would suggest that we have a higher-quality setup, along with more complex encryptions. I would suggest a timer to make the game more intense for players that enjoy that. Overall, I really enjoyed the game and think that it was well done for the time that was given.

            I chose this particular video to talk about HTML because it ties into our lesson from July 2023 about User Experience and how the interface of an app and website are designed. I also think that including basic HTML and CSS together in a short tutorial is a great way to teach others HTML. I really love coding HTMl and this video really hits all of my favorite parts.

             <p>  This meme displays the popular TV show character Pam Beesley holding up two signs comparing data science, also known as DS in the IT world. Machine Learning is using algorithms models to analyze and draw conclusions from patterns in collected data. Data science is a topic that combines computer science, statistics, AI (artificial intelligence), and Machine Learning to analyze and sort data with algorithms. The meme shows that these two disciplines have very similar definitions and are often mistaken for each other by those who are new in the data science field. Referred to as "DS Noobs" in the meme, this implies that they are new data science students getting their BS/BA or MS in Data Science. This meme provides a humorous way to explain that machine learning and data science are very similar to each other and are often confused with the other by new data scientists.

            Maureen Baginski began working as a cryptologist as a Russian language instructor in 1979 in Russia, the NSA during 9/11, and the FBI. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Baginski was involved in the 9/11 terrorist as she was able to guide the actions of the NSA directly following the attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            She worked for The National Security Operations Center and the Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) as an officer for many years as a cryptologist. However, 
           she was transferred to the FBI where she became the director of Intelligence from 2003-2005. After this, she accepted a position to work as a senior intelligence executive within the FBI. 
        <p>
            Baginski was President of National Security Systems at SPARTA after retiring from the FBI, along with several other companies.
