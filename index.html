        <h4>
        Hi, I am Katharine (Kate) Batista. 
        I live in the USA in New Jersey, and I am 16 years old and going into my senior year of high school.
        <p>
        I decided to take this course this summer because I wanted to experience a class with other people just like me with an interest in technology and data. I was looking for a program that would develop my knowledge in STEM.
        </p>
        <p>
        I want to go into Data Science/ Analytics and Computer Science next year for college. 
        My interest in technology also stems from web design and building apps in MIT App Inventor.
        </p>
        <p>
        Outside of my academics I really enjoy writing and editing poetry and essays. 
        Writing would be my second passion if technology was not my first. I live at home with my parents, two dogs, and three older brothers. 
        One of whom is working in computer science and was the reason that I got into technology. I also love to read and some of my favorite 
        books include SlaughterHouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, The Handmaids Tale by Margret Attwood, The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri, 
        and Beautiful Boy by David Sheff.
        </p>
        I listen to tons of music (especially while I have been at SU) and my favorite artists include Taylor Swift, boygenius, Sun Room, Sam Phillips, Lizzy McAlphine, and Phoebe Bridgers. 
        My favorite/ comfort TV show is Gilmore Girls but I love to watch movies when I am not studying or writing for school- I just do not have a favorite. 
        <p>
        If there is anything I want to include is that I have always felt different for knowing I want to be in STEM and for not being\
        undecided in life so I am really excited for this program. 
        I also was here for the previous session where I took Computer Animation and Game Design, so if anyone needs help with anything
        on campus I am familiar with the surroundings. 
        </p>
